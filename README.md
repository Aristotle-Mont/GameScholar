I’ve successfully built a mobile-friendly web application that helps newcomers to the US learn about NFL and NBA. Here’s what I’ve created:

✅ Features Implemented:

Home Page - Welcoming landing page with quick access to all features and sports statistics
Teams Page - Browse 8 NFL and 8 NBA teams with detailed information (logos, stadiums/arenas, divisions/conferences, team colors, and founding years)
Learning Hub - Beginner-friendly explanations of football and basketball rules, scoring systems, positions, and common violations
Favorites System - Save your favorite teams with a heart icon and view them all in one place (uses localStorage, so your favorites persist)
Live & Fantasy Page - Direct links to 9 platforms:
Fantasy Football: ESPN, Yahoo, NFL Fantasy
Fantasy Basketball: ESPN, Yahoo, NBA Fantasy
Sports Betting: PrizePicks, DraftKings, FanDuel
Mobile-First Design - Bottom navigation bar, responsive layout, and sports-themed colors (blue, orange, green, red)
🎨 Design Highlights:

Clean, modern interface optimized for iPhone and all mobile devices
Gradient headers with sports energy
Color-coded cards for easy navigation
Smooth animations and hover effects
Can be installed as a home screen app on iOS
📱 How to Use: The app is already running in preview mode! You can:

Navigate using the bottom bar (Home, Teams, Learn, Favorites, Live)
Tap the heart icon on any team to add it to favorites
Click external links to visit fantasy and betting platforms
Switch between NFL and NBA content using the tabs
Next Steps:

Preview the app in the App Viewer to test all features
Click Publish to deploy it online and get a shareable link
Share with friends who are new to American sports!
